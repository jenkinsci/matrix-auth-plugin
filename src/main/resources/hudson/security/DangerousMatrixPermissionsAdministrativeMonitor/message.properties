blurb = Your jenkins is currently configured to enable granting at least one of the permissions that can be used to escalate permissions and execute arbitrary code to users without Overall/Administer permission: \
  <ul> \
    <li>Run Scripts</li> \
    <li>Configure Update Center</li> \
    <li>Upload Plugins</li> \
  </ul> \
  <br\> \
  <b>These permissions have been marked as DEPRECATED as of Jenkins v2.222 and will be removed completely in a future release.</b><br\> \

  It is recommended that you remove these permissions, or grant Overall/Administer to affected users or groups: \
