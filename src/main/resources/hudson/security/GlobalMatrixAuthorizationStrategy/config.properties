ambiguous=This table contains rows with ambiguous entries. This means that they apply to both users and groups of the specified name. \
  If the current security realm does not distinguish between user names and group names unambiguously, and if users can either choose their own user name or create new groups, this configuration may allow them to obtain greater permissions. \
  It is recommended that all ambiguous entries are replaced with ones that are either explicitly a user or group.
